In dark mode “What Our Clients Say” on the main page is now not seen well.

Social media icons throughout the site lead to nowhere due to me not having social media for photography. They’re unnecessary at this point but I like to recover them later. Hide them for now.

Button “book your date” in the hero header leads to “get in touch section” on the main page which doesn’t have a booking option.

“View all posts” button on the main page scrolls up to the top of the same section on the main page not showing  the blog page with the list of all stories.

On Family & Portrait Photography page the bright section in the dark mode has no visible text (mostly same behaviour on the whole website in the bright section in the dark mode)

One of the hero rotating images is out of place showing weird picture

Most links of the top and bottom menus lead to the bottom part of the pages instead of the top.

In portfolio all the pictures have “View Full Size” or “click to view” but they don’t show the full size or are unclickable. Also it would be nice to have some consistency (giving only one option “Click to view” or “View Full Size”

Test all links and see if they actually leading to appropriate place or page according to the architecture of the website. Add missing content.

“Read More” buttons of the blog section are not active (they don’t lead to the full articles).
