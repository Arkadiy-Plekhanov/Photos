## AI Prompt for Website Improvements

**Goal:** Implement minimal, high-impact improvements to the Arcadia Photography website (https://arcadiapphotography.replit.app) to increase organic traffic and service monetization. Focus on changes that are straightforward to implement and provide immediate value.

**Context:** The website is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. You have access to the codebase via the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Arkadiy-Plekhanov/Photos.

**Phase 1: Essential SEO & Performance Enhancements (High Priority)**

1.  **Basic SEO Implementation:**
    *   **Task:** Add dynamic `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags for each main page (Home, Services, Portfolio, About, Blog, Contact). The content for these tags should be relevant to the page's content and include keywords like "Oahu photography," "Honolulu wedding photographer," "real estate photography Hawaii," etc.
    *   **Example for Home Page:**
        ```html
        <title>Arcadia Photography - Professional Wedding, Real Estate & Portrait Photography in Oahu, Hawaii</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Capturing breathtaking moments in Oahu, Hawaii. Specializing in wedding, real estate, and family portrait photography. Book your session today!">
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:** Crucial for search engine visibility and attracting organic traffic.

2.  **Image Optimization:**
    *   **Task:** Implement lazy loading for all images on the website to improve initial page load speed. Consider adding placeholder effects (e.g., blurred low-res image) while the high-res image loads.
    *   **Reasoning:** Large images significantly impact page load time, which affects user experience and SEO ranking.

3.  **Mobile Responsiveness Refinement:**
    *   **Task:** Review all pages for mobile responsiveness. Ensure that text is readable, buttons are easily tappable, and image galleries adapt well to smaller screens. Pay special attention to the navigation menu on mobile devices.
    *   **Reasoning:** A significant portion of website traffic comes from mobile devices; a poor mobile experience leads to high bounce rates and negatively impacts SEO.

**Phase 2: User Experience & Conversion Optimization (Medium Priority)**

1.  **Contact Form Enhancement:**
    *   **Task:** Improve the existing contact form by adding clear labels, input validation (e.g., for email format, phone number), and a confirmation message upon successful submission. Consider adding a dropdown for service type inquiry (Wedding, Real Estate, Family, Other).
    *   **Reasoning:** A user-friendly contact form increases inquiry rates and provides better lead quality.

2.  **Call-to-Action (CTA) Optimization:**
    *   **Task:** Ensure all primary CTAs (e.g., "Book Your Date," "Get Quote") are prominent, clear, and lead directly to the intended action (e.g., the contact form or a booking page). Consider A/B testing different CTA texts or button styles.
    *   **Reasoning:** Clear and compelling CTAs drive conversions and service monetization.

**Instructions for AI:**
*   Prioritize Phase 1 tasks. Once completed, move to Phase 2.
*   Provide detailed steps and code snippets for each implemented change.
*   Report on the impact of the changes, if measurable (e.g., before/after page load times, Lighthouse scores).
*   If any task requires external tools or services (e.g., a specific image optimization service), suggest them with reasoning.
*   Maintain the existing design aesthetic and brand identity.

This prompt aims to guide the AI towards actionable, high-impact improvements that directly contribute to the website's success without overwhelming it with complex, long-term development tasks initially.
