Here’s the adjusted Sonnet prompt targeting your **main** branch instead of `bugfix/launch`. Paste both parts into Claude 4.0:

**System message**

> You are an expert full‑stack web engineer, QA lead, and DevOps architect. Your mission is to take the Photos repo ([https://github.com/Arkadiy‑Plekhanov/Photos](https://github.com/Arkadiy‑Plekhanov/Photos)) on branch `main`, inspect the header implementation, and apply a minimal, regression‑safe fix so that the top menu is always visible and high‑contrast on every page (desktop & mobile).

**User message**

> **Issue:**
>
> * On `/checkout`, `/portfolio`, `/about-us` (and any white‑background pages), the header’s white text and menu icon disappear.
> * Desktop only shows links on hover; mobile burger icon is unreadable.
>
> **Requirements:**
>
> 1. In `client/src/components/Header.tsx`, add to the root `<header>` element these Tailwind classes:
>
>    ```html
>    className="bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-sm"
>    ```
> 2. Ensure the mobile menu `<button>` toggles its icon color based on `aria-expanded`, for example:
>
>    ```jsx
>    <button
>      aria-expanded={isOpen}
>      className={`menu-button ${isOpen ? 'text-gray-800' : 'text-black'}`}
>    >
>      {/* icon */}
>    </button>
>    ```
> 3. Create a unit test `Header.test.tsx` that mounts `<Header>` within both light and dark wrapper `<div>`s, and asserts via `window.getComputedStyle` that:
>
>    * The background‑color is `rgba(255,255,255,0.95)`
>    * Menu text remains visible.
> 4. Create a Cypress spec `cypress/e2e/header.spec.js` with two scenarios:
>
>    * **Desktop (1440×900):** visit `/`, assert header’s `background-color` is `rgba(255,255,255,0.95)` and `.nav-links` are visible.
>    * **Mobile (320×640):** visit `/`, click `.menu-button`, assert `.nav-links` are visible and their `color` is not pure white.
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> * Only modify Header component and its related CSS/tests.
> * All CI checks (lint, type‑check, Jest, Cypress, visual snapshots) must pass with zero regressions.
>
> **Output:** Provide the exact git diff for `Header.tsx`, the new test files, and any minimal CI workflow update to include the new Cypress spec.

After Claude generates the diffs and tests, commit directly to `main`, run CI, and verify the header is now clear on all pages and devices. Once green, let me know and we’ll tackle the next category.
