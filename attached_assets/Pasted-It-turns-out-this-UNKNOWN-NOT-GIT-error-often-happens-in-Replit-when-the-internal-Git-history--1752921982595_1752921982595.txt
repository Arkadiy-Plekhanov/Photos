It turns out this **UNKNOWN\_NOT\_GIT** error often happens in Replit when the internal Git history balloons‚Äîusually because auto-checkpoints or log files stored in `.git` get excessively large (sometimes dozens of GB). Eventually the Git service breaks and can‚Äôt switch branches properly ([Reddit][1]).

### ‚úÖ Why it happens

* Replit‚Äôs built‚Äëin AI checkpoints and file history can create massive `.git` folders over time.
* When you switch branches, the Git pane tries to sync and fails, reporting that "UNKNOWN\_NOT\_GIT" error‚Äîa bug caused by the repository getting corrupted or too large ([Replit Docs][2]).

### üõ†Ô∏è What helped other users

On Reddit, one user reported:

> ‚ÄúI just went through this issue and got hit with the error:
> ‚ÄòUnknown error ‚Ä¶ UNKNOWN\_NOT\_GIT ‚Ä¶‚Äô
> After checking, I realized Replit was saving all the checkpoint history, and my web app ended up being around 32‚ÄØGB because of that.
> To fix it, I had to remix the project, then deleted huge files in the .git folder (which was full of logs) and added a .gitignore.‚Äù ([Reddit][1])

### üß≠ Step-by-step solution

**1. Make a backup or remix the project**

* Remixing creates a fresh clone of your code without the excessive Git history.
* Alternatively, manually download your source code via Turtle, zip it, or use `git clone`.

**2. Clean up `.git`**

If staying in the same project:

```bash
rm -rf .git/logs .git/refs/original
```

Or simply delete the entire `.git` directory and reinitialize‚Äîthen re-add your remote.

**3. Add a `.gitignore`**

Include entries to skip heavy files or unnecessary logs:

```
*.log
checkpoint/
.history/
```

This prevents future buildup.

**4. Reinitialize and reconnect**

Using Shell in Replit:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin <your-git-url>
git add .
git commit -m "Clean slate"
git push -u origin <branch>
```

Or use the Git pane: Initialize, connect to GitHub, commit, then push.

**5. Monitor growth**

Avoid large binary files or letting auto-checkpoints accumulate unchecked.

### üõ†Ô∏è If you still need branches

With the clean project, you‚Äôll be able to switch branches again reliably using either the Git pane or standard Git commands (`git fetch && git checkout <branch>`).

---

### üí° TL;DR

* The `UNKNOWN_NOT_GIT` error is usually caused by an overloaded `.git` folder (too many logs/checkpoints).
* Fix by remixing or cleaning `.git`, adding a `.gitignore`, then reinitializing and pushing.
* After that, Git operations should work smoothly in Replit again.
