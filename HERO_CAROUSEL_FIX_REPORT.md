# Hero Carousel Fix Report
**Date**: July 24, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE

## Issue Identified
The hero section carousel was only showing one image because the IndustryLazyImage component was not preloading all hero images properly.

## Root Cause
1. **Lazy Loading Logic**: Images with `priority={false}` were waiting for intersection observer
2. **Intersection Observer Timing**: Observer was only triggering for visible images
3. **Hero Carousel Design**: All 3 images need to be preloaded for smooth transitions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Priority Loading Fix
```typescript
// BEFORE: Only first image had priority
priority={index === 0}

// AFTER: All hero images have priority for smooth carousel
priority={true}
```

### 2. Enhanced Intersection Observer
```typescript
// Increased rootMargin from 50px to 200px for hero carousel
rootMargin: '200px', // Load 200px before entering viewport for hero carousel
```

### 3. Immediate Priority Loading
```typescript
// Priority images now load immediately without waiting for intersection
if (priority) {
  setInView(true);
  return;
}
```

## Technical Benefits

### Performance Impact:
- **Hero Images**: All 3 images now preload for smooth transitions
- **Carousel Function**: Seamless rotation every 5 seconds
- **User Experience**: No blank slides or loading delays
- **Visual Continuity**: Smooth opacity transitions between images

### Implementation Details:
- **Native Performance**: Uses browser-optimized image loading
- **Quality Optimization**: 60% for first image, 50% for others
- **Responsive Images**: 1440x960 optimized for hero display
- **LQIP Support**: 20px blur placeholders for instant feedback

## Verification Steps
1. **Hero Carousel**: All 3 wedding images should rotate every 5 seconds
2. **Image Quality**: Sharp, properly optimized images at 60%/50% quality
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Opacity fade between images with scale effects
4. **Performance**: No loading delays or blank slides

The hero carousel should now display all three stunning wedding photography images with smooth transitions, creating the intended cinematic effect for the Arcadia Photography homepage.
