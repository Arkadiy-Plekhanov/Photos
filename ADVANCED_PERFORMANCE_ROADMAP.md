## Technical Implementation Details

### Font Optimization Strategy:
```html
<!-- Local font system -->
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/playfair-display.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin fetchpriority="high">
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/inter.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin fetchpriority="high">
```

### CSS Optimization Strategy:
```html
<!-- Critical CSS inline -->
<style>
  /* Essential styles for immediate rendering */
  body { font-family: Inter, system-ui, sans-serif; }
  .hero-section { position: relative; min-height: 100vh; }
</style>
```

### Image Optimization Strategy:
```typescript
// External image elimination
const imageMapping = {
  'photo-1439066615861-d1af74d74000': '/images/landscape-hero.jpg'
};
```

## Business Impact

### User Experience Improvements:
